SemFS is a driver to mount a filesystem where the files can be accessed based
on it's semantic meaning (properties) rather than its location alone. i.e. To
reach an MP3 file based on its id3 data or a JPEG file on ir EXIF data.

SemFS was presented as a poster at the 13th IEEE International Conference on
High Performance Computing in Dec. '06.
